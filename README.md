# Customer-Churn

**Project Overview**
Customer churn is a critical business metric that helps companies understand why customers leave and how to retain them. In this project, we analyze customer behavior using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models to predict churn.

## This project includes:

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data type conversions, and outlier removal.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends, patterns, and key factors influencing churn through visualizations.

**Feature Engineering:** Extracting valuable features to improve predictive modeling.

**Machine Learning Models:** Implementing classification models to predict customer churn.

**Performance Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics like ROC-AUC, accuracy, and F1-score.

**Check the Jupyter Notebook for in-depth EDA and model performance analysis.**

**Key Insights from EDA:**

Most churned customers had shorter tenures.

Certain payment methods are associated with higher churn rates.

Customer service interactions impact customer retention.

High variability in monthly revenue among users.

Account segmentation provides valuable insights for customer retention strategies.

**Machine Learning Models**

Various classification models were tested, including:

**Decision Tree Classifier** - Achieved 93% accuracy.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Achieved 89% accuracy.

**Model Evaluation**

**ROC Curve Analysis:** Assessed model performance in distinguishing churned vs. non-churned customers.

**Confusion Matrix & Classification Report:** Provided insights into precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Conclusion & Business Impact**
Businesses can reduce churn by improving customer service and retention strategies.

Providing personalized offers based on spending behavior can help retain customers.

Implementing alternative payment methods can address high churn rates.
